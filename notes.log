Next Steps:


Commit All and Sync: 
- saves changes to local repository, 
- pulls changes from the remote to sync with local changes, 
- and then pushes changes to the remote repository.

Steps To Convert Notebook to blogpost
1. Download the notebook as a .ipynb file
2. Convert the .ipynb to a markdown (.md) file using command line
    ```
    $ jupyter nbconvert --to markdown 2023-08-04-Machine_Learning_Foundations_Through_QA.ipynb
    ```
3. Move the images folder that was generated in step#2 to ./assets/images/
Eg. move '2023-08-04-Machine_Learning_Foundations_Through_QA_files' folder to ./assets/images/
Note: Do not move to ./_site/assets/images/ since all subfolders under ./_site/ are auto-generated by Jekyll
4. For backup, move the notebook .ipynb file to ./assets/notebooks/
5. Move the .md file to ./_posts
6. Update all image references to include path 'assets/images/'
Old: ![svg](2023-08-04-Machine_Learning_Foundations_Through_QA_files/2023-08-04-Machine_Learning_Foundations_Through_QA_5_0.svg)
New: ![svg](/assets/images/2023-08-04-Machine_Learning_Foundations_Through_QA_files/2023-08-04-Machine_Learning_Foundations_Through_QA_5_0.svg)
Use find and replace all:
Find: '2023-08-04-Machine_Learning_Foundations_Through_QA_files/'
Replace: '/assets/images/2023-08-04-Machine_Learning_Foundations_Through_QA_files/'
Note: the beginning '/' is important
7. Update any latex math referencese from $ to $$.
For some reason ipynb markdown supports single $ sign to indicte $math_formula$ while .md file (or jekyll) requires two $$ sign to indicate $math_formula$.
8. Finally include metadata at the beginning of the article

9. Check locally first by running commands:
'$ bundle update'
'$ bundle exec jekyll serve'
Check out the blog posted at Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
