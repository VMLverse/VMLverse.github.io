## Remembering the confusion Matrix

Remember the Confusion Matrix might be well 'confusing'. One easy way to understand the confusion matrix is to practically associate each section of the confusion matrix to a real event and a prediction. The real event in this case is having a fire vs not having a fire. The predicted event in this case will be alarm ringing vs no alarm. This can be represented as a confusion matrix as below:
