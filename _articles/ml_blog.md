          Most important Python libraries for Machine Learning, Data Science, and Data Visualization
          Optional: Can be picked up later when doing the ML course.
          Use for every project, which is why he recommends doing them now to build a base.
          Follow a free crash course for now, pick up more advanced concepts later if needed.

### Source: Geron ML book
• Code examples: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2
• https://www.dataquest.io/ website
• Joel Grus, Data Science from Scratch (O’Reilly). This book presents the funda‐
mentals of Machine Learning, and implements some of the main algorithms in
pure Python (from scratch, as the name suggests).
• Stephen Marsland, Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective (Chapman and
Hall). This book is a great introduction to Machine Learning, covering a wide
range of topics in depth, with code examples in Python (also from scratch, but
using NumPy).
• Sebastian Raschka, Python Machine Learning (Packt Publishing). Also a great
introduction to Machine Learning, this book leverages Python open source libra‐
ries (Pylearn 2 and Theano).
• François Chollet, Deep Learning with Python (Manning). A very practical book
that covers a large range of topics in a clear and concise way, as you might expect
from the author of the excellent Keras library. It favors code examples over math‐
ematical theory.
• Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, and Hsuan-Tien Lin, Learning from
Data (AMLBook). A rather theoretical approach to ML, this book provides deep
insights, in particular on the bias/variance tradeoff (see Chapter 4).
• Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd
Edition (Pearson). This is a great (and huge) book covering an incredible amount
of topics, including Machine Learning. It helps put ML into perspective.

### Deep Learning:

- - 1 year skilling up full time in DL specifically, first FastAI and then Full Stack Deep Learning and Deep Learning Systems (DLS: https://dlsyscourse.org/lectures/), and then also implementing papers I found interesting
- first FastAI: https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html 
- Two: Full Stack Deep Learning (https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/course/)
- Three: Deep Learning Systems (DLS: https://dlsyscourse.org/lectures/)
