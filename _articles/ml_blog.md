02:37 3. Machine Learning TECH STACK
          Most important Python libraries for Machine Learning, Data Science, and Data Visualization
          Optional: Can be picked up later when doing the ML course.
          Use for every project, which is why he recommends doing them now to build a base.
          Follow a free crash course for now, pick up more advanced concepts later if needed.
